VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The checksum of the package is computed using `checksum -t sha256 -f $bin`.
The checksum can be validated by executing said command on the binary downloaded and installed by the official installer form the [project website](https://surrealdb.com/install):
`iwr https://windows.surrealdb.com -useb | iex`

This package is published in cooperation with the PO Tobie and will be maintaned officially once we have the CD pipeline adjusted for choco.

At this point we dont really have a *proper* installer, ist just a cli tool that can run the db and act as a command line.
I highly suggest you check us out and leave a star at https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me ProphetLamb <prophet.lamb@gmail.com>.

Cheers!
